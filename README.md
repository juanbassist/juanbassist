# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @juanbassist

I like technology, knowing how things work, experimenting and combining it with other areas, not necessarily engineering.

Developing products and services verifying that people use them, motivates me to continue improving, or change course towards something that adds more value to people, always learning along the way.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in systems architectures and automated integrations

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cloud integrations with on premise core systems
